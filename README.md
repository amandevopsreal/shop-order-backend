# Shop Order System Backend Server

The Shop Order System Backend Server is a Node.js application built with Express.js and PostgreSQL as the database. This server provides the backend functionality for managing orders in a shop, including creating new orders, updating order status, and retrieving order information.

## Prerequisites

Before running the backend server, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version >= 12)
- PostgreSQL (version >= 10)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd shop-order-system-backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Update the database connection configuration in the `.env` file, located in the root directory. Provide the appropriate values for your database configuration.

5. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

6. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

The configuration for the server can be found in the `.env` file. You can modify the following variables:

- `PORT`: The port number on which the server will run. Default is `3000`.
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`: Database connection details.
